About Me:
<h3> <br> My name is Gurjit Kaur and I am persuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering at the City College of New York. I was born into a family where the most important decision for a woman was to decide what to cook for dinner. Hence, simply attending a university is a breakthrough for me. After being accepted into the Grove School of Engineering, I began scouting for internships. Although it was a small step up the ladder, I was still moving upwards. I was able to attend programs with companies such as Google and Code to Work. Starting off from non-technical internships at tech companies, my main goal was to learn as much as possible. With every passing summer, I have been climbing further up the ladder. This summer I am interning at Etsy as a Software Engineering Intern on the Shipping Team.

Projects:
<h3> <br> 
TrashBot <br>
	I collaborated with a team to use Google's Vision API to scan trash and label it to make it easy to recycle. We created a single page application that would allow people to take a picture of their trash and it would return back the bin that it needs to go in. 
<br> <br>
Listing Reference SlackBot <br>
	I collaborated with a team of 4 other women in tech to create a Slack bot that provides link references of edgecases for testing Etsyâ€™s listing page, the most trafficked page on the site. I created a reference for product teams to test their code against as we integrated with Slack which when given the correct commands, returned the link to the reference that needs to be tested. This allowed for engineers to have less errors occurring on the main webpage.
